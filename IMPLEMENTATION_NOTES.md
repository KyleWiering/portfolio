# Dammen (Dutch Checkers) Implementation Notes

## Implemented Features

### 1. King Jumping Mechanics (Full Diagonal Distance)
**Location:** `src/managers/checkersManager.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Modified `getJumpMoves()` method to handle king long-distance jumps
- Kings can now scan along diagonals to find opponent pieces at any distance
- Kings can land at any empty square after jumping over an opponent
- Regular pieces maintain standard 2-square jump behavior

**Code Changes:**
- Lines 417-543: Enhanced `getJumpMoves()` with separate logic for kings and regular pieces
- Lines 740-798: Added `executeJumpMove()` validation for variable jump distances

### 2. King Jump Restrictions (Cannot Jump Two Pieces)
**Location:** `src/managers/checkersManager.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added validation in `executeJumpMove()` to count pieces along jump path
- If more than one piece is found in the jump path, move is rejected
- Error message: "Cannot jump over two pieces in one move"

**Code Changes:**
- Lines 789-797: Validation loop that checks for multiple pieces in jump path

### 3. Removed Piece Rotation
**Location:** `src/behaviors/checkersBehavior.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Removed rotation animation from `animate()` method
- Pieces now remain static and don't rotate during gameplay

**Code Changes:**
- Line 23-25: Emptied `animate()` method body

### 4. Bot Player Implementation
**Location:** `src/managers/checkersManager.ts`, `src/checkers.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added bot player that automatically makes moves for one color
- Bot uses scoring system to evaluate moves:
  - Captures worth 10 points
  - King promotion worth 5 points
  - Moving kings worth 1 point
  - Random factor for variety
- Bot always plays opposite color from starting player
- Bot waits 500ms before making moves (natural feel)
- Bot can perform multi-jumps automatically

**Code Changes:**
- Lines 37-40: Added `botEnabled`, `botColor`, and `botThinking` properties
- Lines 873-935: Implemented `makeBotMove()` method with move evaluation
- Lines 937-1003: Added `getValidMovesForPiece()` helper
- Lines 1005-1088: Added `getJumpMovesWithPositions()` helper
- Lines 1090-1098: Added `wouldBecomeKing()` helper
- `src/checkers.ts` lines 254-258: Integrated bot triggering in `updateHUD()`

### 5. Color Switching on Game Restart
**Location:** `src/managers/checkersManager.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added `startingPlayer` property to track who starts each game
- On `initializeBoard()`, starting player alternates between white and black
- Bot color is set to opposite of starting player
- Ensures fair gameplay with both colors getting to start

**Code Changes:**
- Line 35: Added `startingPlayer` property
- Lines 62-67: Switch starting player and bot color on board initialization

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] Pieces do not rotate during gameplay
- [ ] King can jump from any diagonal distance
- [ ] King cannot jump over two pieces in one move
- [ ] Bot makes moves automatically for its color
- [ ] Bot can perform captures and multi-jumps
- [ ] Starting player alternates on game restart
- [ ] Bot color changes when starting player changes

### Known Limitations
1. Bot uses simple move evaluation (not deep search)
2. Bot has random element so moves vary
3. No difficulty levels (single AI strength)

## Files Modified
1. `src/behaviors/checkersBehavior.ts` - Removed rotation
2. `src/managers/checkersManager.ts` - King jumps, bot player, color switching
3. `src/checkers.ts` - Bot integration in game loop

## Build Instructions
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing Instructions
```bash
# Start local server
npx http-server src -p 8080

# Navigate to
http://localhost:8080/checkers.html

# Test scenarios:
1. Make a move as white player
2. Observe bot (black) makes automatic move
3. Get a piece to king status
4. Try king long-distance moves and jumps
5. Restart game and verify colors switch
```
